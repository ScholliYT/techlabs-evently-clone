# Evently - Find events, sign up, meet new people!

There are a ton of things to do in the Dortmund areaâ€¦ and a lot of people to do them with! Evently offers users an online platform on which to meet other users with shared interests and bond in real life by attending fun events in the Dortmund area. The website therefore facilitates finding and participating in social activities - something some people struggle with, because they are new in town or because prolongued Covid-quarantines have impaired their social skills.


## How to Setup and Run

In order to setup and run the project, please proceed as follows:

```
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

start python application

either via VSCode (Run & Debug) or via `python3 main.py`

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000
and open http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs

```

## Examples

You can see a brief overview of how to use the main functionality below

```
Backend:

def load_csv_data() in app/main.py:
- loads data from csv file into database

via http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs
GET event (reading all events)
POST event (manually adding events to database)
GET event by id
PUT event (update event information)
DELETE event

Frontend:

- filtering events (skipping to categories)
- being transferred to website when clicking on event
- creating own events

```
